# Face Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains a simple face detection project using OpenCV (cv2 module). The project demonstrates how to use Haar cascades to detect faces in a video stream.

## Introduction

Face detection is a computer technology used in various applications that identify human faces in digital images. This project uses OpenCV, a powerful library for image processing, to implement face detection using pre-trained Haar cascades.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-opencv.git

    cd face-detection-opencv

    pip install -r requirements.txt
